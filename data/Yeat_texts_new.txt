[Verse].
Yeah, bitch, I'm on the drugs, that's what we on.
I had to take a break from X, I feel it in my heart.
But I had to walk 'round before I had a car.
If I don't slow down, I won't make it far.
If you push me to the edge, I'm jumpin' extra far.
New Amiri jeans, when I ask what you want, bitch say a million things.
I just bought the AP, bitch, I got a million sinks.
Flush all my diamonds down the toilet, bitch, they flawless rings.
Yeah, I woke up on the Perc', man, I took a bean.
Yeah, I just left the Earth, they askin', "What that mean?".
I just walked in that bitch with flawless diamonds, yeah, new Celine.
I can't rock with them broke boys, you ain't on the team, yeah.

[Chorus].
Ooh, ya.

They asked if I want diamonds, I said, "Ya-ya".
They asked if I make money, I said, "Ya-ya".
She just asked me, "What these diamonds is?" I said, "A yacht, yacht".
They asked, "How many square feet in your house?" I said, "A lot, lot".
I just went and bought the Urus then I took it off the lot.
I ain't try yet, I ain't give nothing that I got.
Yeah, don't try me, bitch, I swear to God.
Finna touch a mill' then open the world's first lean bar.
(Man, what the fuck?).

[Chorus].
When you rich like this, it feel great.
When you get a lot of shit on your plate.
When you get to the top with the dawgs.
You get to flex all that shit in their face.
You could tell them lil' boys a disgrace.
You could tell that we been in first place.
You could tell that I go in this Tonka.
To hell what I look to, to hell what I chase.
I'm just ridin' in the Tonka, bitch, I'm on this shit.
You don't know how the fuck it feel to be this fuckin' rich.
I just popped a X pill and half my body glitched.
I thought everybody stayed the same, everybody fuckin' switched.
[Verse].
Had to take a break from X, bitch, I could feel it in my chest.
Bitch, I need a Percocet before I start to get upset.
We get rowdy, we go crazy, we gon' turn up for that check.
Had to go and put some diamonds on my neck so they show me some respect.
I said, "Fuck yo Masi', bitch, I'm in a Lamb' truck," yeah.
Might go hit my garage and pull out the GLE for fun.
We could be shittin' on 'em all day, we do it for fun.
They said that they went and touched the moon, I touched the sun.
I went and got me the Tonka, that big body, bitch, I bagged back, I went and just ran it up.
I don't be savin' my money, I spend it all day, bitch, I made it all back, yeah, I doubled up.
Thotty gon' pull up on me, she gon' gulp up my dick like a motherfuckin' 7-Eleven cup.
I could keep goin' for days but I just gotta chill just so they think that they close to us.
Yeah, turn this shit up, they are not close to us.
We some real rockstars, it's a pill, pop all of 'em.
I got beef with my kidney, he said that we got a problem.
He must've thought that we was kidding, my twizzy pulled up and just popped him.
I don't feel the sun, no, not at all.
I'm inside my home, I'm turning up but I'm not alone.
I just got the Chrome Heart, mixed it up, then sauced it on.
My bitch gon' pull up on me, eat my bone, she bite it off.
.
[Chorus].
When you rich like this, it feel great.
When you get a lot of shit on your plate.
When you get to the top with the dawgs.
You get to flex all that shit in their face.

You could tell that I go in this Tonka.
To hell what I look to, to hell what I chase.
